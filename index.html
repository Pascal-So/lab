    <h3>This is the new BIT-101 LAB.</h3>
    <p>I plan to post regular visual code experiments here. Shooting for daily, but at least several per week.</p>
    <p>You'll be able to find the code here: <a href="https://github.com/bit101/lab">https://github.com/bit101/lab</a></p>
    <p>A lot of the code will use some of my personal JavaScript libraries.</p>
    <p>The <a href="https://github.com/bit101/bitlib">bitlib</a> library is a collection of useful functions for manipulating HTML Canvas, math functions, a random number generator, some animation and color stuff. This will grow and change over time.</p>
    <p>The <a href="https://github.com/bit101/quicksettings">QuickSettings</a> library creates a panel with various types of controls for changing values in real time.</p>
    <p>Feel free to use any of these in your own projects.</p>
