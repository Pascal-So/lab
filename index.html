<p>This is the new BIT-101 LAB.<p>
<p>I plan to post regular visual code experiments here. Shooting for daily, but at least several per week.</p>
<p>You'll be able to find the code here: <a href="https://github.com/bit101/lab">https://github.com/bit101/lab</a></p>
<p>A lot of the code will use some of my personal JavaScript libraries.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/bit101/bitlib">BITLIB</a> is a collection of useful functions for manipulating HTML Canvas, math functions, a random number generator, some animation and color stuff, and probably more stuff to come.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/bit101/quicksettings">QuickSettings</a> is a library that creates a panel with various types of controls for changing values in real time.</p>
<p>Feel free to use any of these in your own projects.</p>
